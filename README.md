## Welcome to Conducto

[Conducto](https://www.conducto.com/) is a tool for writing, visualizing,
executing and debugging pipelines, both on your local host and in the cloud.
A pipeline is just a sequence of commands that must be executed in a specific
order. See how easy it is to write and run a pipeline in Conducto by checking
out our demo.

First, follow one of the [Getting Started](
https://medium.com/conducto/getting-started/home)
tutorials for Linux, macOS, Windows, or WSL.

Then, clone and run the demo.

    git clone https://github.com/conducto/demo.git
    cd demo
    python demo.py hello --local

Conducto is particularly powerful for **CI/CD** and **Data Science**. We have
dedicated demos and tutorials for each. Choose your own adventure!
